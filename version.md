**Version 0.04**
- Neuron input via dendrite and synapses. Iterative solution - untested.
- Higher-level arch: Network -> Layer -> Neuron -> Synapse.
- Axon struct added.

**Version 0.03**
- Function name changes.
- Starting put it all together.
- MNIST reader copied over.
- Network struct.
- Network building based on Cuntz2007 - untested.

**Version 0.02**
- Redesign of neuron and synapse around a more data-centered focus rather than an OOP design. Shifting away from pointers.

**Version 0.01**
- First version of the VecS class which uses spherical geometry to track and move synapses.
- Might also be the first version to use the Tester.hpp file. My own brand of janky unit testing.

**Version 0.00**
- Began adaption from ver3 from the Artificial Dendrites paper and the start of the next step forward.
- "Everything should be easier than it is." Anna Turing.
