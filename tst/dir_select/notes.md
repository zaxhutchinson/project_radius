# Model of Computation

A dendrite can be interpreted in various mathematical ways, none of which are perfectly suited to the dendrite. The repeated, sequential application of one or more functions to a signal can be modeled through functional composition. The dendrites recursive nature forms a recurrence relation of some finite depth where each dendritic compartment maps the output of the previous compartment(s) along with additional signals to its own codomain.

Trainable artificial dendrites can be modeled as self-modifing functions (or self-modifing code). Modifications to their properties--weights, synaptic positions, compartments, and branches--make use of output. This is true of biological dendrites as well. Somatic potentials move back into the dendrite which cause changes in synaptic strength.

Sparse connectivity along with function composition allows AD neurons to be better function approximators than point neurons. Taylor series?
